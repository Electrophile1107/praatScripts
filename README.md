- Wordlist labeler

Used for such situation: A long recording of a wordlist and a textgrid which has unlabeled intervals. The labeler avoids typing labels that are not in the wordlist. After setting one label, it typically proceeds to the next label, but you can adjust the label flexibly if there are repeated tokens.
